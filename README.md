# Verifying-the-normal-theory-when-the-model-is-correct
The theory says that, under the standard assumptions, the distribution of the least squares estimates are known.
Let's conduct some simulations to verify the theory. 
Consider the model y = ô€€€1 + 3x + error where x is one-dimensional and error ~iid N(0, 1)
(The numbers are more or less arbitrary.)
